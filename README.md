# Color-Match

### this rudimentary ios game was built using swiftUI on x-code
### the game contains two different colored circles, and 3 sliders - one for red, one for green, and one for blue. The sliders manipulate the rgb code for each primary color from 1 to 255 (0,0,0 being black, 255,255,255 being white). The goal of the game is to manipulate the sliders until the second circle is the same color as the first. When you think you've gotten it right, hit the submit button and you will receive a rating of 1  -  4 stars. Hit the reset button to reset the sliders and the target color.

### I'm handing it in in the interest of meeting the deadline, however some elements I'd still like to implement are: a) A more accurate scoring system as the current one is pretty broad. maybe a points system instead of rating system - the closer the player gets to the original color the more points they get
###               b) A leaderboard
###               c) additional levels - maybe using shapes? the sliders could manipulate padding,                      border-radius, height and width, etc..
